<p align="left">This project is a user management application built using React and Redux Toolkit. The application allows users to view and filter a list of users fetched from an API. Redux Toolkit is used for state management, providing a robust solution for managing the application's state. <br>One of the major challenges in this project was integrating Redux Toolkit. As someone who started learning Redux specifically for this task, the process involved familiarizing myself with Redux Toolkitâ€™s concepts and best practices. Using createSlice and configureStore simplified state management and reduced boilerplate code compared to classic Redux. <br>The design of this application was inspired by my previous web project a password manager described in my CV. The goal was to create a clean and user-friendly interface that facilitates easy interaction with the user data.</p>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
